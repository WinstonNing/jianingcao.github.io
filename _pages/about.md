# About me
I am a postgraduate student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Supply Chain Logistics Management. 
I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Kunming University of Science and Technology, where I graduated with GPA 3.49/4 (Ranking 2/78). My academic journey was marked by a strong commitment to excellence, as evidenced by my participation in numerous competitions focused on mathematical modeling, logistics, and transportation. These experiences not only sharpened my analytical and problem-solving abilities but also earned me several awards.
My scholarly work has been recognized and published in reputable journals such as Energy, Computers & Industrial Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics and etc. These publications showcase my contributions to the field and my dedication to advancing knowledge in logistics and operations research.

Currently, I am deeply engaged in research at the predict-driven optimization and roubust optimization.
My work focuses on developing optimization models that can effectively navigate the complexities and uncertainties inherent in urban tranportation system, like electric vehicle charging scheduling optimization, charging faculity location problem, and drone-based logistics 
routing optimization, and etc.
This cutting-edge research is not only theoretically significant but also has practical implications for enhancing operational efficiency and resilience in real-world scenarios. 
As I continue to expand my academic and research profile, I am eager to collaborate with peers and professionals in the field, and to contribute to the operations research.
