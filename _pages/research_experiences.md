## Charging Stations Precise Siting Project of Yunnan Province
Supervisor: Dr. Nan Pan

China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd.
1.	Analyzed the existed layout of charging posts and urban POIs in Kunming
2.	Constructed a city charging demand forecasting model through Matlab
3.	Constructed a mixed integer programming model for site selection and capacity determination based on bilevel optimization.
4.	Identified the expansion plan of urban charging facilities using Python

## Supply Chain Logistics Optimization for Power Metering Devices
Supervisor: Dr. Nan Pan

China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd.
1.	Analyzed existing power metering devices distribution pattern
2.	Developed a mathematics model for power supply bureaus and stations to determine the inventory and optimize the distribution plan
3.	Designed a resilience strategy to enhance the reliability in the emergency scenarios
4.	Developed a novel heuristics algorithm to solve the established model
